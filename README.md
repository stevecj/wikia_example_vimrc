# Example .vimrc file from wikkia.com

This repository contains a copy of the example .vimrc file from the 
http://vim.wikia.com/wiki/Example_vimrc page.

The example .vimrc on wikia is very populat and useful, but it is not
available from wikia directly as an independent file and must instead be
copied out or extracted from the larger page in which it is presented.
That's fine unless you want to install that example as part of a setup
script.

This repository exists for the sole purpose of providing access to that
example as an independent file that you can directly download and use.
